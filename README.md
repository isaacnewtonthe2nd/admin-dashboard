Whew! This took a while. This project demontrates how grids and flexbox can be used hand in hand to layout a webpage. It takes some getting used to, especially when deciding when and when not to use them and this webpage was a test for that. As you may have noticed, this looks like an actual brand, but it is actually a brand I created in my head which is what took me a while. I used imported svg for the little icons, canva to design the profile pictures of each person, and imported google fonts to style the logo. As for the rest, it was mostly html and css. I can confidently say this was a success, although they are some things I would like to improve, I will leave that for the near future when I hone my skills better. The css layout can also be better, Its a little all over the place, but I plan on making it look cleaner. Until then!
